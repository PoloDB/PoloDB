PoloDB is an embedded JSON-based database.

[中文版](README_CN.md)

# Features

- Simple/Lightweight/Easy to learn and use
- Various language bindings
- Embedded (No standalone processes, no cross-process calls)
- No runtime dependency
- NoSQL
- MongoDB-like API
- Cross-Platform
- Store data in ONE file

# Introduction

PoloDB is a library written in Rust
that implements a lightweight [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

PoloDB has no dependency(except for libc),
so it can be easily run on most platforms (thanks 
for Rust Language).

The data of PoloDB is stored in a file.
The file format is stable, cross-platform, and
backwards compatible.

The API of PoloDB is very similar to MongoDB.
It's very easy to learn and use.

# Platform

Theoretically, PoloDB supports all platforms that the Rust compiler
supports.
But PoloDB is a personal project currently.
Limited by my time, I have only compiled and tested on the following platforms:

- macOS 10.15 x64
- Linux x64 (Tested on Fedora 30)
- Windows 10 x64

# Manual

- [Rust](https://docs.rs/polodb_core)
- [Node.js](./docs/en-US/Node.js/READEME.md)
